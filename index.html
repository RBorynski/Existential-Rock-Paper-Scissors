<article><p>It seems that computers can do <i>almost </i> anything. As time passes and technology becomes more advanced, that word <i> almost</i> becomes less and less operative. After all, what can't computers do? They are taking our jobs. Every daily function of society and of every individual within that society is reliant on them. In 1997, you learned how to use the computer. In 2017, the computer learns how to use you.</p>
<p>There is, however, something that computers can't do. They can't act on impulse. They don't make mistakes. Everything they do has a reason behind it. Nothing they do is random.Coincidence is not an option.</p>
